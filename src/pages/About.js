                    <h4 className='font-overpass font-light text-purple-light pt-10'>My name is Celine Kallemein, and I am a 20 year old Dutch student currently studying Creative Media &amp; Game Technologies at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. Here, we learn programming and design in several different areas such as: Web development, app development, game design and development, UI/UX design, and much more. Throughout college we work with team-based projects that last either one period, or a full semester.</h4>
                    <h4 className='font-overpass font-light text-purple-light pt-10'>As for my personal expertise, I specialize in Front-End development, game art and design, game development, 3D-art, and lastly UI/UX design. Next to that, I also have experience in using Photoshop, Illustrator, Microsoft Word, Figma, Unity, Blender3D and Github. As a game- and 3D-artist I am mostly self taught, though I have pursued some professional courses to help learn the more advanced features of certain programs and techniques.</h4>
                    <h4 className='font-overpass font-light text-purple-light pt-10 pb-7'>I have a great passion for game art and development and wish to find a future career as an indie game developer or artist. I seek a lot of inspiration from existing indie game developers, who made it big on the gaming market through ambition and determination. Iâ€™m always eager to learn something new or further expand my current skillset to match that of my teammates and/or colleagues. I love being part of a team of social and ambitious people.</h4>
