                    <h4>Androchtizo is a 3D Unity horror game made by me and a group of seven total during the Global Game Jam in 2020. During this event, you are given 48 hours to build a game based on a specific theme.</h4> 
                    <h4 className='py-5'>The theme of 2020 was 'Repair', where we took this concept and created a horror type game where the player wakes up with only an arm and no eyes. The goal of the game is to collect different bodyparts and 'repair' yourself while recollecting memories of what happened.</h4>
                    <h4 className='py-5'>Though we largely used pre-existing free assets for this project, I did set up and build the terrain that the story takes place in, and helped with some of the details and decor of the scenery. This was my first time ever using Unity.</h4>

For this, we decided to make a serious game that would bring more awareness to the situation and promote any related charities</h4>
                    <h4 className='py-5'>We spent the first half of the semester planning and designing a concept for the project. After this I mainly worked on creating the 3D lowpoly models of the characters, setting up the terrain, and jumping in to help with the programming where needed.</h4>
